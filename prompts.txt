PROMPT 1: Add Dropdown for Variable Selection
================================================================================

USER PROMPT:
"insert a dropdown into the UI allowing users to select at least 1 of these 
options: danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, 
instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo"

AI RESPONSE:
Added a selectInput dropdown widget to the UI that allows users to select 
multiple variables. The dropdown includes all 11 music feature variables with 
multiple selection enabled.

CODE CHANGES:
- Added sidebarLayout structure to ui
- Added selectInput widget with all 11 variables in the sidebar
- Set multiple = TRUE to allow selecting multiple variables

================================================================================

PROMPT 2: Plot Effects of Each Selected Variable
================================================================================

USER PROMPT:
"for my output$plots it should be plotting the effect of each numeric variable 
in input$variables"

AI RESPONSE:
Updated the output$plots to iterate through each variable in input$variables and 
create effect plots for each one. The implementation uses ggpredict() from the 
ggeffects package to compute marginal effects for each variable, then arranges 
all plots in a grid layout.

CODE CHANGES:
- Added library(gridExtra) for arranging multiple plots
- Modified output$plots to use lapply() to loop through each variable in 
  input$variables
- For each variable, uses ggpredict(glm_mod(), terms = var) to compute effects
- Uses plot() to convert ggeffects objects to ggplot objects
- Arranges all plots in a grid using grid.arrange() with 2 columns
- Added check to ensure plots exist before arranging

PROMPT 3: Add Navigation Bar for Multiple Features
================================================================================

USER PROMPT:
"if the app i have now is one feature, how can i add a nav bar to have multiple 
features."

AI RESPONSE:
Converted the app from fluidPage() to navbarPage() to enable a navigation bar 
with multiple pages/features. The navigation bar allows users to switch between 
different features, each in its own tab.

CODE CHANGES:
- Changed fluidPage() to navbarPage() 
- Wrapped existing GLM Model functionality in tabPanel("GLM Model")
- Added a placeholder "Feature 2" tabPanel to demonstrate multiple pages
- Removed titlePanel() as navbarPage() uses its first argument as the title
- The navigation bar now appears at the top with tabs for each feature
- Each tabPanel can contain its own complete UI layout and functionality
